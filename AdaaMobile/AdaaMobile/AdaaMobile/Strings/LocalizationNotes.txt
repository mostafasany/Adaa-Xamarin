****If it doesn't work in DEBUG mode (Android only)

If the translated strings are working in your RELEASE Android builds 
but not while debugging, right-click on the Android Project 
and select Options > Build > Android Build 
and ensure that the Fast assembly deployment is NOT ticked.
This option causes problems with loading resources 
and should not be used if you are testing localized apps.
